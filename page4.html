                            <p>As most of you know, Facebook has recently changed it's policy when sharing links to your pages and timelines. You can no longer change the link image. So when you copy and paste the link into your status update, you're stuck with whatever image populates. Here's a way to get around this!<br><br>First of all, type in your caption (or copy it from our pre-written copy <a href="page1.html">here</a>).<br><br>Once you enter a URL into the draft of your post, Facebook will populate a link and clickable image...automatically. But you don't want that. Hover over the link that is created, and press the "X" in the top right corner. That will delete the clickable link. But never fear, people can still click the link in your caption to get to your destination.<br>Next you want to add the image.<br>Choose the option:<br>Upload Photos/Video: Add photos or a video from your computer. The photos you publish will be added to your Page's Timeline Photos album.<br>Select the photos or videos you want to add<br>Click Publish<br></p>
